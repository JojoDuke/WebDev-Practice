# WebDev-Practice
Welcome to my Web Development repository. This is where I'll keep most of my website projects.<br>
I'll document everthing from practice sites, experiments, learning outcomes, actual full-fledged projects and anything else.<br>
<br>


## 1.Great Fire of London
My first serious(ish) website. Its a sort of brief rundown of the great fire of London, I used this to get started in Bootstrap especially. Made this in about 4 days.<br>
**Technologies Used:** HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap

## 2.Marvel Movies
A bootleg Marvel website. For this one I tried using more vanilla CSS instead of relying on Bootstrap, I feel like having a grasp on basic CSS itself will help greatly when using Bootstrap. So far its kinda confusing but I'am getting a hang of things. Made this in 9 days<br>
**Technologies Used:** HTML/CSS, Javascript
